## Business Problem

A travel booking website seeks to implement a feature that predicts whether a flight is likely to be delayed due to weather. This insight will enable customers to make informed decisions, potentially improving their satisfaction and loyalty to the platform.

## Success Metrics

The primary metrics for success include:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Measured using precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for the class of delayed flights.
- **Model Robustness**: Ensuring that the model performs consistently across different subsets of data through cross-validation.

## Dataset

The project uses flight and weather data, including:
- Historical flight records with variables indicating delays.
- Weather data from various airports, capturing factors such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and more.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The data is collected from public sources and prepared for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New variables are created to capture trends, such as seasonal effects and weather conditions.
4. **Model Selection**: Logistic regression was selected for initial modeling, with potential exploration of other algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.

## Model Development

- The data is split into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A logistic regression model is trained using the training set.
- Various performance metrics are computed to evaluate model performance on the test set.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: 0.79
- **Classification Report**:
